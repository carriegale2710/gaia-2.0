# Doctor: verify the GAIA Code deployment

When the user runs `/doctor`, run these checks and print a ✅/⚠️/⏭️ checklist.
This skill is **read-only**: no commits, no file writes, no Space changes.

## Checks

1. **Engine files.** Confirm each of `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`, `MEMORY_ENGINE.md`, `PLAN_ENGINE.md`, `BUILTINS.md`, and
   `TURN_ENGINE.md` is available to you as a Space file (you read them at startup —
   if one is absent from your context, it was not uploaded). ⚠️ for any file you are confident is missing;
   ⏭️ if you are genuinely uncertain whether it was uploaded — do not report ⚠️ on a file you might
   simply not have seen yet. Fix for ⚠️: upload the missing file per https://gaiacode.pro/get-started.
2. **Skills directory.** Confirm the `skills/` folder is present in the Space
   files and contains at least one `.md` file beyond `README.md`. ⚠️ if absent or
   empty — GAIA's slash-command skills will not be available. Fix: re-upload
   the skills bundle per https://gaiacode.pro/get-started.
3. **Version consistency.** In `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`, the header
   `# GAIA CODE — SYSTEM PROMPT (v<version>)` and the PART VII footer rule
   `Running GAIA Code <version>` must carry the same number. ⚠️ on mismatch —
   the Space is running mixed file versions; redeploy all files.
4. **Up to date?** Read `website/package.json` from repo
   `alexey-max-fedorov/gaia-ai` on `master` via GitHub MCP `get_file_contents`
   (a read — no approval needed) and compare its `"version"` against the local
   version, numerically component-by-component as `/update` does. ⚠️ if behind;
   ⏭️ "skipped" if GitHub MCP is unavailable.
5. **Memory.** With one `execute_code` call: does `MEMORY.md` exist, and does its
   `## Permissions` section record a `Mode:` line? ⚠️ if the file or the mode is
   missing (GAIA will run Ask Permissions and prompt for a choice on the next
   write).
6. **GitHub MCP.** Call `get_me`. ✅ with the authenticated login on success;
   ⚠️ "not connected" on failure, pointing to https://gaiacode.pro/connectors.

## Output

A short checklist — one line per check, ✅/⚠️/⏭️ plus a one-line fix for every ⚠️ —
followed by a one-line overall verdict. Nothing else.
